# Endless-Maths-the-Game

First of all, unfortunately both the game itself and the code behind it are so heavy for GitHub that I had to upload them in Dropbox and share the links here, this is why this repository has only this readme file in it.

This unity game aims to help students, especially those in middle school and high school, and generally anyone else that is interested, solve basic math equations correctly and very fast, while also making it entertaining and engaging.

The following links contain the folder of the game as well as the folder with all the code that generated the executable game. More specifically it contains:

1) the game folder, which can be found here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/eck38lisk5ducan/AABy7oZJdCDZS23z666FAfdKa?dl=0), has the game itself, meaning the executable file, as well as some extra files that are generated with the creation of the .exe file. All the rules and actions of the game are simple and explained inside it

2) the code folder, which can be found here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bduau4fpcemaydv/Endless%20Maths%20Unity.zip?dl=0) as a .zip file, has every single thing that turns the game into reality such as sprites, animations, music, background images and of course the code itself

Here is a quick summary of the code:

First of all, the character of the game is actually standing still and everything else, meaning the background and the obstacles are moving towards him in a steady pace. The physics of the game are limited to just the interaction of the character with the obstacles as well as the 2 single moves he can perform (going up and down). The other commands the player can give is about starting the game or exiting it which of course trigger the appropriate actions. Last but not least, the equations are generated through an algorithm that chooses randomly the math operation as well as the two different numbers that will be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided by each other. However, there are some rules behind these equations. First and foremost, the product of the operation must not be a negative number, every product is an integer, the product does not exceed 100 and the division must of course produce once again an integer. All these rules can be changed and/or tweaked easily but for the sake of simplicity, because the game is based for minors, they are set like this.

Feel free to experiment with the game and change anything from the sprites to the equation formula that I used!
